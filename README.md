# MusicMaker

Music Master Maker is a hybrid app for both web and iOS that allows music teachers to assign pieces for their students to practice, and for students to use their phones to record their practice sessions and submit them back to the teacher for feedback.

The app has push notifications and emails students when an assignment has been given and to teachers when one has been submitted.

Students sign up by using their iPhone to scan a QR code provided by the teacher.

The app is free for students and has a monthly fee for teachers.
